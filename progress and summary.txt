Tetris project – summary
Tech stack
Python 3 – main language
Pygame – window, drawing, input, mixer
Standard library – random, os, math, array (no numpy or other extra deps)
requirements.txt – pygame>=2.5.0
Project structure
tetris.py – single file: game logic, drawing, sound, main loop
highscore.txt – created at runtime next to the script; stores best score
.vscode/settings.json – editor config (optional)
Game mechanics
Grid – 10×20, standard Tetris well
Pieces – 7 tetrominoes (I, O, T, S, Z, L, J), each with 4 rotations stored as 2D matrices
Movement – left/right, rotate (up), soft drop (down), hard drop (space), hold (C), pause (P)
Ghost piece – semi-transparent preview of landing position
Lock delay – 0.5 s after landing before lock; moving/rotating resets the timer (“slide”)
Spawning – piece centered using bounding box (handles I vertical, etc.)
Scoring & level
Line clear – 100 / 300 / 500 / 800 × level for 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 lines (Nintendo-style)
Soft drop – 1 pt per row
Hard drop – 2 pts per row dropped
Level – +1 every 10 lines; fall speed increases (faster until a minimum)
High score – best score saved in highscore.txt
GUI (minimal)
Window – 380×600 px
Play area – 260×520 (block size 26), thin 1px border
Sidebar – right side: HOLD, NEXT (previews), SCORE, BEST, LEVEL, LINES, “P Pause”
Colors – dark theme: BG, GRID_BG, GRID_LINE, SIDEBAR_BG, TEXT, TEXT_MUTED, ACCENT
Blocks – flat rects, 1px outline; ghost = same with lower alpha
Overlays – game over / pause: dimmed background + centered text only (no panels)
Sound
Source – generated in code (sine waves via math.sin + array.array("h")), no WAV files
Mixer – 22050 Hz, 16-bit, mono; pygame.mixer.pre_init then pygame.mixer.init
Events – move, rotate, hard drop, line clear, level up, game over
Fallback – if init fails, play() does nothing; game still runs
Data & logic
State – one dict: locked positions, current/next/hold shape indices, rotation, position, score, level, lines, fall/lock timers
Collision – valid_position(shape, x, y, locked)
Line clear – find full rows, remove them, shift above rows down, then update score/level
Spawn X – get_spawn_x(matrix) from bounding box so every rotation spawns centered
Controls (as in game)
Key	Action
← →	Move
↑	Rotate
↓	Soft drop
Space	Hard drop
C	Hold
P	Pause
Space (game over)	Restart
Run
pip install -r requirements.txtpython tetris.py
That’s everything used in the project so far in one place.
